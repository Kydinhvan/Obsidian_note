Refer to BRAIN Research Papers for Users forums or find more papers on notable research platforms and finance journals like: SSRN, Seeking Alpha, Wilmott, etc.

One approach to read a paper is:
- Focus on the **abstract**, **hypothesis**, and **conclusion** to get the overall ideas.
- Then move to the **introduction** or literature for **more in-depth** research.
- For implementation details, refer to the **methodology** section.

Usually initial idea implementation on BRAIN might not be as expected. Try different combinations of operators and variables.

Lastly, remember you are investing your time in developing alphas. If you struggle with a particular idea for too long, it is reasonable to "cut losses" and move on to another idea.
