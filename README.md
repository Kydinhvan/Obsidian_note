# Obsidian_note

This is my personal Obsidian vault where I store notes and documents related to my learning journey. It includes content from various subjects, coding practice, and general technical knowledge.

## Purpose

This repository helps me:

- Organize my learning material
- Keep track of what I’ve studied
- Back up my notes with version control

Feel free to browse if you’re interested in the topics
