## Asynchronous Processing

Asynchronous processing allows a program to perform tasks without waiting for others to complete. This is particularly useful in I/O operations where waiting for a resource could block other tasks. Instead, tasks can be started and the program can move on to other tasks while waiting for the initial tasks to complete.

**Example**: Making an HTTP request. The program can initiate the request and then continue executing other code. When the response is received, a callback function can be executed to handle the response.

## Concurrent Processing

Concurrent processing involves multiple tasks making progress over time, but not necessarily simultaneously. This can be achieved through various methods like time slicing, where each task is given a small time slot to execute before moving to the next one.

**Example**: Running multiple threads on a single-core processor. Each thread gets a time slice to run, and the operating system switches between them, creating the illusion of simultaneous execution.
